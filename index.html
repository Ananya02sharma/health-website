       <p>  The 7 Steps to good health </p>
 <p> A few simple steps can work wonders in improving your health and overall quality of life. These are simple steps that are easy to incorporate in your daily routine, and you don’t have to go out of the way to be healthy. </p>

<p> 1. Don’t compromise on sleep

Scientific research claims that the human body needs eight hours of sleep every day to stay fit and healthy. If you’re compromising on sleep, you are exposing yourself to serious health problems such as obesity, heart disease, etc.
</p>
 <p> 2. Manage anxiety and stress

Anxiety and stress are bad for your mental and physical health. Busy lives have made us prone to anxiety and stress, and there are many causes of stress in our daily life. Stress can have seriously detrimental effects on your overall health.
</p>
<p>
3. Eat a balanced diet

Don’t skip meals or eat junk food often. Try to keep your diet balanced i.e. your diet should contain all essential nutrients required by your body, such as vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, etc.
</p>
<p>
4. Make exercise a habit

Physical exercise is vital to good health. Exercise not only helps burn extra calories and keep your body in shape but also keeps many diseases at bay. Exercise doesn’t mean that you have to join the gym - brisk walking, jogging, yoga, swimming, or playing an outdoor sport every day can keep you in the pink of your health.
</p>
<p>
5. Don’t sit for long hours

Sitting for long hours can expose the body to a range of health disorders, like high blood pressure, spine problems, obesity, etc. If you have a job that requires you to sit for long hours, make sure that you walk a few steps after every hour of sitting continuously.
</p>
<p>
6. Quit bad habits

Living a healthy life starts with quitting the wrong habits. Keeping bad habits like smoking and drinking alcohol can increase your risk for a range of critical illnesses, such as heart disease, liver failure, etc.

</p>
<p>
7. Protect yourself from pollution

Pollution is everywhere from air to water and soil. We should not pollute our surroundings and also protect ourselves from the pollution around us, whether indoors or outdoors.

Encourage good health with a health insurance policy
While it is important to take the necessary steps to enjoy a healthy life, it is equally important to be cognizant of the fact that a medical emergency can come uninformed. Hence, it is very important to have a mediclaim policy to stay prepared for your future medical needs.

Health insurance policies, including mediclaim policy and family health insurance, offer regular health checkups with encouraging good health and help in the prevention of diseases through timely diagnosis. If you go for health check-ups at regular intervals, many minor symptoms can be treated well in time.

Radical changes start with small steps. So, integrate these simple and useful changes in your lifestyle and say hello to good health! </p>

       <p class="para1 head1"> Steps To Maintain a Nutritionist meal </p>
       <div class="para2 head2"> <p> What you eat each day affects your health and how you feel now and in the future. Good nutrition plays a major role in helping you lead a healthy lifestyle. When combined with physical activity, your diet can help you reach and maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, and promote overall health and wellbeing.
<p>
        Creating and maintaining healthy eating habits doesn’t have to be hard. If you start by incorporating small changes into your daily habits, you can make a big impact on your eating pattern and create lasting, healthy eating habits. Try including at least six of the following eight goals into your diet by adding one new goal each week.
       </p>
       <p>
       1. Make half your plate fruits and vegetables
Choose red, orange, and dark-green vegetables along with other vegetables for your meals. Add fruit to meals as part of main or side dishes or as dessert. The more colorful you make your plate, the more likely you are to get the vitamins, minerals, and fiber your body needs to be healthy. </p>
<p>
2. Make half the grains you eat whole grains
Switch from a refined-grain food to a whole-grain food. For example, choose whole-wheat bread instead of white bread. Read the ingredients list and choose products that list a whole-grain ingredients first. Look for things like: “whole wheat,” “brown rice,” “bulgur,” “buckwheat,” “oatmeal,” “rolled oats,” quinoa,” or “wild rice.”
</p>
<p>
3. Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk
Both have the same amount of calcium and other essential nutrients as whole milk, but fewer calories and less saturated fat. </p>
<p>
4. Choose a variety of lean protein foods
Protein foods group includes not only meat, poultry, and seafood, but also dry beans or peas, eggs, nuts, and seeds. Select leaner cuts of ground beef (where the label says 90% lean or higher), turkey breast, or chicken breast. </p>
<p>
5. Compare sodium in foods
Use the Nutrition Facts label to choose lower sodium versions of foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals. Select canned foods labeled “low sodium,” “reduced sodium,” or “no salt added.” 
</p>
<p>
6. Drink water instead of sugary drinks
Drink water to cut back on unnecessary calories from sugary drinks. Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks are a major source of added sugar and calories in American diets. To add flavor to your water, add a slice of lemon, lime, apple or fresh herbs like mint or basil. </p>
<p>
7. Eat some seafood
Seafood has protein, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids (heart-healthy fat). Adults should try to eat at least eight ounces a week of a variety of seafood. Children can eat smaller amounts of seafood. Seafood includes fish such as salmon, tuna, and trout and shellfish such as crab, mussels, and oysters. </p>
<p>
8. Cut back on solid fats
Eat fewer foods that contain solid fats. The major sources for Americans are cakes, cookies, and other desserts (often made with butter, margarine, or shortening); pizza; processed and fatty meats (e.g., sausages, hot dogs, bacon, ribs); and ice cream.
